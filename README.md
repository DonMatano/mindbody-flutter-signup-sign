# Sign in UI for MindBlown

A UI Flutter project that shows a sign up page. This was done as a coding challenge of [Weekly Coding Challenge](https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/2019/03/double-slider-sign-in-up-form/)

My main aim is to learn Flutter using these challenge.

UI inspiration was from [Miles Cartwright](https://dribbble.com/mcartw20) Dribble [Login UI](https://dribbble.com/shots/6478687-MINDBODY-app-login)
